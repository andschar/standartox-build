\section*{Background \& Summary [max 700 words]}

A large number of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides and synthetic hormones are in daily use all over the world with insufficient knowledge about possible adverse effects on the environment. In Europe alone some 100,000 chemicals are estimated to be in current use, whereof 30,000 are produced in quantities larger than one ton per year \citep{breithaupt_costs_2006}. Chemicals are brought to the environment deliberately - as it is the case of pesticides, or arrive therein as a byproduct from other processes (e.g. atmospheric emissions or wastewater) \citep{schwarzenbach_challenge_2006}. Ecosystems provide essential services to human societies such as drinking and irrigation water, food and climate regulation. These services are products of different ecosystem functions that crucially depend on the integrity of the populations and communities that drive these ecosystem functions. However, besides habitat degradation, climate change and nutrient enrichment, pollution with man-made chemical toxicants threatens these populations and communities in various ways which are currently not fully understood \citep{steffen_anthropocene_2007}. Pollution with man-made chemical toxicants was indeed identified as one of three major environmental problems for which research gaps hamper the derivation of planetary boundaries, i.e. thresholds beyond which irreversible state shifts may occur \citep{steffen_anthropocene_2007}. Bernhardt et al. \citet{bernhardt_synthetic_2017} argue further that the knowledge gap how chemicals effect populations and communities and hence ecosystem functions and ecosystem services, would also impede society’s ability to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. According to Breithaupt \citet{breithaupt_costs_2006} less than one percent of chemicals released to the environment are thoroughly tested. Although for some chemicals advanced and standardized \citep{oecd_oecd_2018} test methods have been developed, ecotoxicological tests for a lot of chemicals, especially newly emerging ones remain scarce and if existent, the information is represented sparsely and in inconsistent formats. \citep{gessner_fostering_2016}. Therefore we developed a data base that collects, processes and aggregates ecotoxicological tests results in order to subsequently publish it in an harmonized form as a web application - the \etoxbase tool: \href{http://139.14.20.252:3838/etox-base-shiny/}. This should facilitate researchers the access to ecotoxicological test results and support modern chemical risk assessment (CRA) workflows. The \etoxbase makes use of ecotoxicological test data, obtained from the ECOTOXicology knowledgebase (ECOTOX) created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ECOTOX collects raw, non harmonized ecotoxicological test data on on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife as well as plants and publishes it on a quarterly basis. By the time of writing it contained 926,108 test results, comprising 11,685 chemicals tested on 12,668 different species \citep{elonen_ecotoxicology_2018}. The collected ecotoxicological test data contain a variety of measured endpoints such as Effective Concentrations (\ecfifty{}) values, No-observed effect concentrations (NOEC) or lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC). Likewise the data set contains different effect measures such as mortality, intoxication and growth as well as a multiplicity of test durations ranging from seconds to weeks or even years. The \etoxbase aggregates this information according to the user's inputs. These can then be used for the derivation of risk indicators such as Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) \citep{posthuma_species_2002} and Toxic Units (TUs), which represent two prominent concepts to assess effects on organisms in ecotoxicology . The former combines toxicity data of several organism groups towards a chemicals to estimate effects on biotic communities, the latter refers to effects of a specific organism (group) towards a chemical. The two concepts are widely used in ecotoxicology \citep{kefford_definition_2011, schafer_effects_2011} since the allow for a comparison of toxicities across multiple chemicals and biological communities, respectively. Although performed on one and the same organism and chemical, outcomes of different ecotoxicological tests vary greatly due to differences in test parameters, genetic differences in individual populations or other irrepressible factors making a selection of appropriate test results for CRA laborious. The \etoxbase{} aims to relief this process and provide single toxicity values for organism, chemical and test duration combinations. The \etoxbase{} downloads every new version of the ECOTOX data base and performs several quality checks, e.g. unit harmonization, and cleaning steps on it. Hence, new scientific test results are constantly incorporated. Additionally the \etoxbase{} queries chemical- and organism-specific variables from other open data bases to fill information gaps such as water solubility, organism habitat or regional occurrence patterns in the ECOTOX data base.

\section*{Methods}

%%The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures 
%%used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental 
%%design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. 
%%normalization, image feature extraction). Related methods should be grouped 
%%under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described 
%%in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, 
%%the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data 
%%citation (see Data Records and Data Citations, below). Authors should cite 
%%previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method 
%%descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce 
%%the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. 
%%There is no limit to the length of the Methods section.

The \etoxbase{} consists of two parts of software: Firstly a processing pipeline (Fig. \ref{fig:pipeline}) downloads quarterly released new versions of the \epa{} and performs several preparation steps in R \citep{r_core_team_r_2017}, to then store the outcome in a PostgreSQL data base. This constitutes the basis upon which the R shiny web application is accessing the data \citep{r_core_team_r_2017}. The application itself is set of R functions that filter and aggregate the data according to a user's inputs \ref{fig:app}. Finally in the web application, a `filtered` and an `aggregated` data set as well as an interactive plot, for data exploration are returned. These two data sets can be downloaded. In the following these two parts are explained in detail, naming the respective R scripts in brackets.

\subsection*{Data acquisition \& preparation}

The EPA ECOTOX data is downloaded (bd\_epa\_download.R) and subsequently built into a PostgreSQL data base (bd\_epa\_postgres.R). Afterwards the data is imported into R for pre-processing (da\_epa1.R, da\_epa2.R, da\_epa3.R), which includes validity checks, removal of special characters, unit harmonizations and selection of relevant variables. Chemical abstract service (CAS) numbers, unique chemical identifiers together we taxon names are then used to query other data bases for additional information on chemicals and biota respectively. Chemical information is retrieved from the Compendium of Pesticide Common Names (qu\_aw.R) \citep{CITE_AW}, the Chemspider data base (qu\_chemspieder\_scrape.R) \citep{CITE-CHEMSPIDER}, from Eurostat <CITATION>, the Pubchem data base (qu\_pc.R) \citep{CITE_PUBCHEM}, and from the Physprop data base (qu\_pp.R) \citep{CITE_PHYSPROP}. These queries mostly rely on the webchem R-package \citep{szocs_webchem_2015-1}. For biota, habitat and occurrence information is queried from the World Register of Marine Species (WORMS) (qu\_worms2.R) \citep{WORMS} and from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (qu\_rgbif.R) \citep{CITE_RGBIF} using the rgbif R-package \citep{chamberlain_rgbif_2018}. The acquired information is then merged (re\_merge.R) and information is combined (re\_combine.R). From there on the data set is analysed (re\_analyses.R) and checked (re\_checks\_internal.R) and finally compiled in one table (re\_final.R). This table is then used as the input for the filter and aggregation functions \ref{fig:pipeline}. For a detailed overview of what information is collected see table \ref{tab:scripts-pipeline}.

    \label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{The application}
The application is accessible through \app{} and was built in R, using the shiny web application framework \citep{chang_shiny_2018}. Users can define several input parameters \ref{tab:inputs} in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), handled in the ui.R script in order to adjust the aggregation according specific requirements. In doing so users execute R functions (fun\_filter.R, fun\_aggregation.R, fun\_filagg\_plot\_ly.R) loaded in the server.R script, which produce a 'filtered' and an 'aggregated' data set as well as an interactive overview plot. Only the 'aggregated' data set is presented in the GUI. However, both data sets can be downloaded via a download button.

\begin{figure}
    \includestandalone[scale=0.75]{tikz/application}
    \caption{Application}
    \label{fig:app}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Aggregation}
The \etoxbase{} application aggregates the test results according to chosen filters in a two step process. Firstly the filtered test results are aggregated by the CAS number, the chosen taxon and the selected test duration. Secondly, the returned data is then aggregated by the CAS number. The former can't be influenced by the user and calculates either the minimum or the median depending on the amount of results to aggregate (n <= 2: minimum, if n > 2: median). Thereof the second step calculates the minimum, the maximum, the median, the geometric mean, or the arithmetic mean as an aggregate. 







\subsection*{Code availability}
%%For all studies using custom code in the generation or processing of datasets, 
%%a statement must be included here, indicating whether and how the code can be 
%%accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section should also include 
%%information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific 
%%variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset. 

The processing code is stored in a Github reopsitory (\git{}). All processing scripts were written in R version 3.4.4. PostgreSQL 9.5 has been used to build the data base. Hence, R together with its packages \ref{tab:rpackages} and PostgreSQL suffice to rebuild the process. The code of the application itself is stored in a second Github repostitory (\gitapp{}). Since new versions of the EPA ECOTOX data base are published on a quarterly basis the data acquisition process is automated and new versions of the application are scheduled to be released regularly.

The \etoxbase{} is designed to support CRA of ecotoxicologists. With an increased amount of available ecotoxicological test data, it becomes fundamental to provide and distribute such information in reasonable formats, meaning accessible for humans as well as machines. Currently CRA often relies on test results of a few, well tested standard organism, such as \textit{Daphnia magna}, \textit{Pimephales promelas}, \textit{Selenastrum capricornutum}, although researchers have conducted experiments on a much greater variety of organisms (e.g. the 926,108 test results collected in the EPA ECOTOX data base). In order to locate ecotoxicological test data, researchers can rely on individual test results reported in publications <CITE>, on compiled and published data sets \citep{malaj_organic_2014} or on data bases such as the Pesticide Property Data Base (PPDB) \citep{lewis_international_2016}. Each data source has its limitations though: Collecting toxicity information from individual publications is laborious and using already compiled data from publications or data bases is often limited to a specific groups of chemicals, such as pesticides, biozides etc. The \etoxbase{}, making use of the EPA ECOTOX data base, the largest publicly available collection of ecotoxicological test results, aims to facilitate the data retrieval process by providing adequate aggregates (\ecfifty{}, NOEC, LOEC) of the tests results. These are then used for the calculation of SSDs, TUs or other risk indicators. SSDs try to extrapolate effects of chemicals towards organisms from species to a community level by fitting a statistical distribution to toxicity test results on organisms of different trophic levels in order to derive concentrations at which a specific fraction of organisms are effected (often at 5\% - HC\textsubscript{5} \citep{posthuma_species_2002}. Figure \ref{fig:ssd-isoproturon} shows an example of a SSD and the derived HC\textsubscript{5} value (red dassed line) created for the herbicide Isoproturon. TUs are another indicator of effects of chemicals on organisms. They are calculated by dividing a measured concentration (c) by an \ecfifty{} value (cf. Equation \ref{eq:tu}).

\begin{equation}
    TU_i = \frac{c_i}{\ecfifty}
    \label{eq:tu}
\end{equation}

    \label{fig:ssd-isoproturon}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Filter and Aggregate}

In the application's GUI, the user can choose among different parameters to filter and aggregate the test data accordingly \ref{tab:inputs}. Percentage values next to inputs show the proportion of the respective option (e.g. \textit{Active Ingredient - 43\%} indicates that 43\% of the data are Active Ingredients). The user can filter for compound-specific filters, including the CAS number, the concentration type (e.g. Active Ingredient, Formulation), the chemical class (e.g. Insecticides, Metals) and taxon-specific filters, including common taxonomic groups (e.g. Daphniidae, Algae), the organism habitat (e.g. freshwater) and the continent (e.g. Europe, Asia). Regarding the test parameters the user can choose test durations (in hours), Effect groups (e.g. Mortaliy, Population, Growth) and Endpoints (\ecfifty, EC\textsubscript{10}, LOEC or NOEC). Besides that, two cleaning steps can also be chosen. Firstly the application allows to exclude test results exhibiting concentrations that are higher than the actual water solubility of the respective chemical at \ang{20} C. Secondly the user can choose to exclude outliers (cf. Table \ref{tab:scripts-app}). The outliers are selected as values that exceed lower (0.25) and the upper (0.75) quartile by 1.5 times the inter-quartile range. As aggregates the user can choose the minimum, the maximum, the median, the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean. All the steps described in this section are selectable in the GUI and are executed at each click by the application. The drop down menu `Download data` allows to download a filtered data set as well as an aggregated data set.
The \etoxbase{} application can be accessed here: \app{}.

\subsection*{Limitations}

Generally it has to be stated that the returned values are subject to change, as new tests will be constantly incorporated into the \etoxbase{}. However, we expect values of well tested chemical-organism combinations to be relatively stable. The returned values are certainly influenced by individual tests characteristics, such as pH, temperature or conductivity to just name a few, which influences the effect relationship between chemicals and organisms \citep{rosenkrantz_influence_2013,li_temperature_2011}. Unfortunately the EPA ECOTOX data base has only rare records on test parameters, which prevents incorporating such parameters in an aggregation <proportions of available data: Temperature:77\%, pH:56\%, hardness:27\%, dissolved oxygen:18\%, Alkalinity:15\%, salinity:9\%, others:<=5\%>. However, using the median or the geometric mean as an aggregate allows for an adequate estimation of the central tendency of the toxicity of a chemical towards an organism group. The geometric mean is recommended, as it is in comparison to the arithmetic mean considerably less influenced by outliers and is suitable for skewed data. Also, the geometric mean is preferable in contrast to the median, since the median completely ignores the influence of large or small values, making it unreliable for small data sets <CITATION GEOMETRIC MEAN>.

Other initiatives, with different, though partly overlapping aims accumulating existing ecotoxicological test data are published online. The PPDB provides validated ecotoxicological test results for pesticides, narrowing chemicals to this group \citep{lewis_international_2016}. The Network of reference laboratories, research centres and related organisations for monitoring of emerging environmental substances (NORMAN) focuses on assembling river basin specific pollutants\citep{von_der_ohe_new_2011}. The EnviroTox data base \href{https://envirotoxdatabase.org/} makes also use of the \epa{} data in order to derive Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) \citep{health_and_environmental_sciences_institute_hesi_envirotox_2019}. In comparison to the \etoxbase, these examples partly rely on the same data, yet not aiming to derive \ecfifty, LOEC and NOEC from it automatically.

\section*{TODO}

\begin{itemize}

\item compare Etox-BAse output with PPDB

\item plot example SSD and TU

\item acute vs chronic

\item OECD guidlines are not machine readable

\item discuss flaws in column types (e.g some concentration entries contain '+' or '~' and are therefore not convertable to numeric) - This hampers large scale analysis greatly!

Put in citation \citep{hartung_chemical_2009} ? which claims that REACH won't meet their assumptions and say 54 million vertebrate animals are needed for tests that would cost €9.5 billion over the next ten years. I.e 20 times more animals, 6 times the costs in comparison to the official estimates
