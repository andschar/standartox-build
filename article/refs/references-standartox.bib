  abstract = {Despite a changing world in terms of data sharing, availability, and transparency there are still major resource issues associated with collating datasets that will satisfy the requirements of comprehensive pesticide risk assessments especially those undertaken at regional or national scale. In 1996 a long-term project was initiated to begin collating and formatting pesticide data to eventually create a free-to-all repository of data which would provide a comprehensive transparent, harmonised and managed extensive dataset for all types of pesticide risk assessments. Over the last 20 years this database has been keeping pace with improving risk assessments, their associated data requirements, and the needs and expectations of database end users. In 2007 the Pesticides Properties DataBase (PPDB) was launched as a free-to-access website. Currently, the PPDB holds data for almost 2300 pesticide active substances and over 700 metabolites. For each substance around 300 parameters are stored covering human health, environmental quality and biodiversity risk assessments. Approaching the twentieth anniversary of the database this paper seeks to elucidate the current data model, data sources, its validation and quality control processes and describes a number of existing risk assessment applications that depend upon it.},

  abstract = {Organic chemicals can contribute to local and regional losses of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, their overall relevance regarding larger spatial scales remains unknown. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first risk assessment of organic chemicals on the continental scale comprising 4,000 European monitoring sites. Organic chemicals were likely to exert acute lethal and chronic long-term effects on sensitive fish, invertebrate, or algae species in 14\% and 42\% of the sites, respectively. Of the 223 chemicals monitored, pesticides, tributyltin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and brominated flame retardants were the major contributors to the chemical risk. Their presence was related to agricultural and urban areas in the upstream catchment. The risk of potential acute lethal and chronic long-term effects increased with the number of ecotoxicologically relevant chemicals analyzed at each site. As most monitoring programs considered in this study only included a subset of these chemicals, our assessment likely underestimates the actual risk. Increasing chemical risk was associated with deterioration in the quality status of fish and invertebrate communities. Our results clearly indicate that chemical pollution is a large-scale environmental problem and requires far-reaching, holistic mitigation measures to preserve and restore ecosystem health.},

  shorttitle = {Worldwide Decline of the Entomofauna},
  abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

The result showed that the EC50-values for the relative root length were 9.24, 4.91 and 3.62 mM Cd at 18, 25 and 30 1C, respectively. The Cd concentrations in the cellular metal-sensitive fraction or the potentially toxic fraction (cell debris fraction-Cd) were well correlated with the toxicity of Cd. Interestingly, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in wheat roots without Cd exposure were increased at 18 1C compared to those at 25 1C, while decreased at 30 1C. The CAT activities decreased with increasing Cd level at 25 and 18 1C but did not show the same change at 30 1C, which could be explained by the subcellular distribution of Cd. \& 2011 Elsevier Inc.

  volume = {409},
  issn = {00489697},
  abstract = {Given the huge number of chemicals released into the environment and existing time and budget constraints, there is a need to prioritize chemicals for risk assessment and monitoring in the context of the European Union Water Framework Directive (EU WFD). This study is the first to assess the risk of 500 organic substances based on observations in the four European river basins of the Elbe, Scheldt, Danube and Llobregat. A decision tree is introduced that first classifies chemicals into six categories depending on the information available, which allows water managers to focus on the next steps (e.g. derivation of Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), improvement of analytical methods, etc.). The priority within each category is then evaluated based on two indicators, the Frequency of Exceedance and the Extent of Exceedance of Predicted NoEffect Concentrations (PNECs). These two indictors are based on maximum environmental concentrations (MEC), rather than the commonly used statistically based averages (Predicted Effect Concentration, PEC), and compared to the lowest acute-based (PNECacute) or chronic-based thresholds (PNECchronic). For 56\% of the compounds, PNECs were available from existing risk assessments, and the majority of these PNECs were derived from chronic toxicity data or simulated ecosystem studies (mesocosm) with rather low assessment factors. The limitations of this concept for risk assessment purposes are discussed. For the remainder, provisional PNECs (P-PNECs) were established from read-across models for acute toxicity to the standard test organisms Daphnia magna, Pimephales promelas and Selenastrum capricornutum. On the one hand, the prioritization revealed that about three-quarter of the 44 substances with MEC/PNEC ratios above ten were pesticides. On the other hand, based on the monitoring data used in this study, no risk with regard to the water phase could be found for eight of the 41 priority substances, indicating a first success of the implementation of the WFD in the investigated river basins.},

Geometric means are suitable for datasets which follow log-normal distributions. Medians are a kind of robust treatment. However, their 'efficiency' is verylow. Based on the methods described, two new ideas are developed: 'robust' and 'symmetric', for calculating means. As far as the symmetricfeature is concerned,Box-Coxpowertransformationis better than logarithmictransformation.Robust statistics and Box-Coxtransformationare combinedto producethe 'robust-symmetricmean'. As environmentaldata often follow log-normalor skewed distributions, this method is better than the previous ones and also is appropriate.},

  shorttitle = {A Review on Emerging Contaminants in Wastewaters and the Environment},
  abstract = {This review identifies understudied areas of emerging contaminant (EC) research in wastewaters and the environment, and recommends direction for future monitoring. Nonregulated trace organic ECs including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and personal care products are focused on due to ongoing policy initiatives and the expectant broadening of environmental legislation. These ECs are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, mainly derived from the discharge of municipal wastewater effluents. Their presence is of concern due to the possible ecological impact (e.g., endocrine disruption) to biota within the environment. To better understand their fate in wastewaters and in the environment, a standardised approach to sampling is needed. This ensures representative data is attained and facilitates a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends of EC occurrence. During wastewater treatment, there is a lack of suspended particulate matter analysis due to further preparation requirements and a lack of good analytical approaches. This results in the under-reporting of several ECs entering wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and the aquatic environment. Also, sludge can act as a concentrating medium for some chemicals during wastewater treatment. The majority of treated sludge is applied directly to agricultural land without analysis for ECs. As a result there is a paucity of information on the fate of ECs in soils and consequently, there has been no driver to investigate the toxicity to exposed terrestrial organisms. Therefore a more holistic approach to environmental monitoring is required, such that the fate and impact of ECs in all exposed environmental compartments are studied. The traditional analytical approach of applying targeted screening with low resolution mass spectrometry (e.g., triple quadrupoles) results in numerous chemicals such as transformation products going undetected. These can exhibit similar toxicity to the parent EC, demonstrating the necessity of using an integrated analytical approach which compliments targeted and non-targeted screening with biological assays to measure ecological impact. With respect to current toxicity testing protocols, failure to consider the enantiomeric distribution of chiral compounds found in the environment, and the possible toxicological differences between enantiomers is concerning. Such information is essential for the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment.},

However, at the PCp value, species richness in nature would not necessary be p\% less than at uncontaminated sites. The definition of species richness inherent to SSDs (contaminant category richness) contrasts with species richness typically measured in most field studies (point richness). We determine, for salinity in eastern Australia, whether these definitions of stream macroinvertebrate species richness are commensurable. There were strong relationships (r2 ! 0.87) between mean point species, family and Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera species richness and their respective contamination category richness. Despite differences in the definition of richness used by SSDs and field biomonitoring, their results in terms of relative species loss from salinity in south-east Australia are similar. We conclude that in our system both definitions are commensurable.},

Their multiple industrial, domestic, agricultural, medical and technological applications have led to their wide distribution in the environment; raising concerns over their potential effects on human health and the environment. Their toxicity depends on several factors including the dose, route of exposure, and chemical species, as well as the age, gender, genetics, and nutritional status of exposed individuals. Because of their high degree of toxicity, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury rank among the priority metals that are of public health significance. These metallic elements are considered systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure. They are also classified as human carcinogens (known or probable) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This review provides an analysis of their environmental occurrence, production and use, potential for human exposure, and molecular mechanisms of toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity.},

  volume = {21},

  abstract = {Exposure to agrochemicals in the aquatic environment often occurs as time-varying or repeated pulses. Time-varying exposures may occur due to runoff events and spray drift associated with precipitation and application events. Hydrologic dilution, dispersion, and degradation also produce pulsed exposures. Standard laboratory toxicity tests using constant exposure concentrations typically do not investigate the toxicity of time-varying or repeated exposures. Detoxification, elimination, and recovery may occur within organisms or populations during the periods between exposures. The difficulty of estimating effects of realistic time-varying exposures from measurements made under constant exposure conditions is often an important source of uncertainty in ecological risk assessment of pesticides. This article discusses the criteria and tools for deciding whether time-varying exposures are relevant in a particular risk assessment, approaches for laboratory toxicity testing with time-varying exposure, modeling approaches for addressing effects of time-varying exposure, deterministic and probabilistic ecological risk characterization of time-varying exposures and toxicity, and uncertainty analysis.},

  abstract = {Mixotrophy, used herein for the combination of phototrophy and phagotrophy, is widespread among dinoflagellates. It occurs among most, perhaps all, of the extant orders, including the Prorocentrales, Dinophysiales, Gymnodiniales, Noctilucales, Gonyaulacales, Peridiniales, Blastodiniales, Phytodiniales, and Dinamoebales. Many cases of mixotrophy among dinoflagellates are probably undocumented. Primarily photosynthetic dinoflagellates with their ``own'' plastids can often supplement their nutrition by preying on other cells. Some primarily phagotrophic species are photosynthetic due to the presence of kleptochloroplasts or algal endosymbionts. Some parasitic dinoflagellates have plastids and are probably mixotrophic. For most mixotrophic dinoflagellates, the relative importance of photosynthesis, uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients, and feeding are unknown. However, it is apparent that mixotrophy has different functions in different physiological types of dinoflagellates. Data on the simultaneous regulation of photosynthesis, assimilation of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients, and phagotophy by environmental parameters (irradiance, availablity of dissolved nutrients, availability of prey) and by life history events are needed in order to understand the diverse roles of mixotrophy in dinoflagellates.},

When it was published in the WHO Chronicle, 29, 397-401 (1975), an annex, which was not part of the Classification, illustrated its use by listing examples of classification of some pesticidal active ingredients and their formulations. Later suggestions were made by Member States and pesticide registration authorities that further guidance should be given on the classification of individual pesticides. Guidelines were first issued in 1978, and have since been revised and reissued every few years. Up until the present revision the original guidelines approved by the World Health Assembly in 1975 have been followed without amendment. In December, 2002 the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UNCETDG/GHS) approved a document called 'The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals' with the intent to provide a globally-harmonized system1 (GHS) to address classification of chemicals, labels, and safety data sheets. The GHS (with subsequent revisions) is now being widely used for the classification and labeling of chemicals worldwide. For this revision of the Classification the WHO Hazard Classes have been aligned in an appropriate way with the GHS Acute Toxicity Hazard Categories for acute oral or dermal toxicity as the starting point for allocating pesticides to a WHO Hazard Class (with adjustments for individual pesticides where required). It is anticipated that few of the more toxic pesticides will change WHO Hazard Class as a result of this change. As has always been the case, the classification of some pesticides has been adjusted to take account of severe hazards to health other than acute toxicity (as described in Part II). The GHS Acute Toxicity Hazard Category for each pesticide is now presented alongside the existing information."--Page.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict the effects of toxicants in organisms with reasonable accuracy depends to a great extent on the toxico-kinetic models used to describe such effects. Toxic effects of organic chemicals and heavy metals have been described adequately using a hyperbolic model that considers the concentration of the toxicant and the time of exposure only. Such a model relies on the median time to effect (ET50) of a chemical to estimate effects at any exposure time, but cannot make predictions for concentrations other than those tested experimentally. A complementary log-to-log model can calculate all ET50 values for a toxicant, thus enabling the hyperbolic model to predict any level of effect for any combination of concentrations and times of exposure. The parameter values used in both models are obtained from experimental bioassays where the time-to-effect of a toxicant is recorded regularly in addition to standard acute or chronic toxicity data. These models will facilitate the risk assessment of chemicals by (1) predicting effects under any combination of time and concentrations, and (2) reducing to a minimum the experimental efforts required to obtain comprehensive ecotoxicity data.},

  abstract = {Data on toxicity of chemicals is usually reported as the LD50, or LC50, with the exposure time from experimental testing in the laboratory reported. But the exposure time is not considered to be a quantifiable variable which can be used to evaluate its importance in expressed toxicity, often described in general terms such as acute, chronic and so on. For the last hundred years Habers Rule has been successfully used to extrapolate from reported exposure times to other exposure times which may be needed for setting standards, health risk assessments and other applications. But it has limitations particularly in environmental applications where exposure levels are low and exposure times are relatively long. The Reduced Life Expectancy (RLE) model overcomes these problems and can be utilised under all exposure conditions. It can be expressed as ln(LT50) = {\`A}a (LC50)n + b where the constants n, a and b can be evaluated by fitting the model to experimental data on the LC50, and corresponding LT50, together with the Normal Life Expectancy (NLE) of the organism being considered as a data point when the LC50 is zero. The constant, n, at a value of unity gives a linear relationship and where n {$<$} 1 the relationship has a concave shape. In our extensive evaluations of the RLE model for fish, invertebrates and mammals involving 115 data sets and with a wide range of organic and inorganic toxicants the RLE model gave correlation coefficients of {$>$}0.8 with 107 sets of data. The RLE model can be used to extrapolate from a limited data set on exposure times and corresponding LT50 values to any exposure time and corresponding LT50 value. The discrepancy between Haber's Rule and RLE model increases as the exposure time increases.},

The aim is to guarantee that safe use can be achieved for the intended use of the product. This paper provides a feedback on the regulatory environmental risk assessment performed for pesticide registration at the EU and member state levels. The different steps of pesticide registration are addressed considering both exposure and hazard. In this paper, we focus on the environmental fate and behaviour in surface water together with the aquatic ecotoxicity of the substances to illustrate pesticide regulatory risk assessment performed for aquatic organisms. Current methodologies are presented along with highlights on potential improvements. For instance, as regards exposure aspects, moving from field based to landscape risk assessments is promising. Regarding ecotoxicology, ecological models may be valuable tools when applied to chemical risk assessment. In addition, interest and further developments to better take into account mitigation measures in risk assessment and management are also presented.},

Here, we report that aquatic systems are threatened by the high toxicity and persistence of neonicotinoid insecticides. These effects cascade to higher trophic levels by altering food web structure and dynamics, affecting higher-level consumers. Using data on zooplankton, water quality, and annual fishery yields of eel and smelt, we show that neonicotinoid application to watersheds since 1993 coincided with an 83\% decrease in average zooplankton biomass in spring, causing the smelt harvest to collapse from 240 to 22 tons in Lake Shinji, Shimane Prefecture, Japan. This disruption likely also occurs elsewhere, as neonicotinoids are currently the most widely used class of insecticides globally.},

Environmental data are continuously expanding, requiring flexible, scalable, and extendable data management solutions that can harmonize multiple data sources with potentially differing nomenclatures or levels of specificity. Here, we present the methodological steps taken to construct a rule-based labeled property graph database, the ``Meta-analysis of the Global Impact of Chemicals'' (MAGIC) graph, for potential environmental impact chemicals (PEIC) and its subsequent application harmonizing multiple large-scale databases. The resulting data encompass 16,739 unique PEICs attributed to their corresponding chemical class, stereo-chemical information, valid synonyms, use types, unique identifiers (e.g., Chemical Abstract Service registry number CAS RN), and others. These data provide researchers with additional chemical information for a large amount of PEICs and can also be publicly accessed using a web interface. Our analysis has shown that data harmonization can increase up to 98\% when using the MAGIC graph approach compared to relational data systems for datasets with different nomenclatures. The graph database system and its data appear more suitable for large-scale analysis where traditional (i.e., relational) data systems are reaching conceptional limitations.},

  abstract = {There is a wide concern that emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) in surface water could adversely affect human health and wildlife. However, the geographic distribution, exposure pattern and ecological risk of emerging organic pollutants are poorly understood at a global scale. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the exposure level of EOPs in China, the US and the EU based on the published literature. The hazard level of three categories of EOPs, namely pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides and industrial chemicals was further evaluated by adopting a novel Aquatic HazPi index that jointly accounts for the persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity and bioactivity. Furthermore, a correlation analysis of land use with the surface water exposure status regarding the synthetic chemicals was conducted. According to the published data reported between 2010 and 2016, the concentration of pesticides in the US was higher than in the EU and China. The concentration of PPCPs in the EU was generally lower than in both the US and China, while the concentration of industrial chemicals in China was higher than in the EU and the US. Among the chemicals whose median concentration in surface water was {$>$} 10 ng/L, the antiretroviral Efavirenz, the pesticide Fipronil, and octocrylene, an industrial chemical and cosmetic ingredient, were found with the highest aquatic HazPi value. Lastly, the spatial distribution and concentration of hazardous EOPs was shown to depend on local landscape and land usages. Our study provides the first broad overview on the geographic distribution, exposure pattern of hazardous EOPs in the three major economic entities: China, the US and the EU.},
