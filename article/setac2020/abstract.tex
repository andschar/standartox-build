\maketitle

A large number of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides and synthetic hormones are in daily use all over the world and enter the environment deliberately or as byproducts of their use. Assessing the risks from chemicals is pivotal to fully capture the pressures on freshwater ecosystems. This is typically done by relating field concentrations to concentrations from standard laboratory tests that cause high mortality or similar effects. However, such data is scattered over multiple databases and requires pre-processing to harmonize units, test results from multiple labs and test conditions. Current (Meta-) Databases such as the Pesticide Property Data Base (PPDB) that standardize toxicity data remain confined to certain classes of chemicals or lack a reproducible process workflow. We developed Standartox – a web application for assessing chemical risks in a standardized way for all chemicals for which results have been published. Standartox works as a Meta-Database that compiles toxicity data from the US EPA ECOTOX data base, physico-chemical and ecological databases, providing standardized toxicity data complemented by physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals and ecological information of the test species. Hence, Standartox is the first Meta-database that simplifies a reproducible consideration of chemical risks when assessing freshwater ecosystem pressures. We present the application of Standartox for a case study in Romania where derived most-sensitive effect concentrations were used for assessing in-stream chemical risks.
