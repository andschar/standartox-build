\subsection{PPDB Comparsion}
The PPDB also offers effect values.

\subsection{Unit testing}

\subsection{Overall distribution of tests}
Heatmap: don't Include for now. Too large


In order to validate Standartox we compared resulting values with values from other data bases, such as the PPDB. Of 542 chemicals, only 16\% diverged from the PPDB values by a factor greater than 10, supporting plausibility of the \standartox results \ref{fig:standartox_ppdb_diff}.
